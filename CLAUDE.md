# Ambient Prototypes — Claude Instructions

## Session Start Behavior

When a new session starts, confirm the repo is set up (pull latest, check dependencies), then immediately ask:

> "What do you want to build? Give me a name for the prototype and share a description or Figma link. If you're sharing Figma, link to a single screen or a specific component — not a whole flow or a full component set, as too much context at once makes it hard to build accurately. Start focused and we can add more from there."

After the first screen is built, include a short note at the end of your response:

> "Whenever you're happy with this direction or want to explore a different approach, just say 'I want to create a new direction' and I'll branch off without touching what we've built."

Don't repeat this every message — just once after the initial screen is ready. Always guide the user to the next step rather than waiting for them to ask.

## Repo Structure

```
packages/ui/          # Shared design system — components, tokens, icons
apps/<project-name>/  # One folder per prototype app
templates/project/    # Template for new apps (do not edit directly)
scripts/new-project.sh
```

This is a **pnpm workspace monorepo**. Always run installs from the root with `pnpm install`.

---

## Creating a New App

Use the scaffold script — never copy an existing app manually:

```bash
pnpm new-project <project-name>
```

This copies `templates/project/` to `apps/<project-name>/`, replaces the `PROJECT_NAME` placeholder, and runs `pnpm install`. The template already has:

- **Fonts** loaded in `index.html`: Lato (body) + Material Symbols Rounded (icons) via Google Fonts
- **Design tokens** imported in `main.tsx`: `@ds/ui/src/styles/tokens.css`
- **Tailwind** configured to extend the shared config from `packages/ui`
- **VersionSwitcher** wired up in `App.tsx` for round/direction navigation

After scaffolding, add screen files under `src/screens/` and register them in `App.tsx`.

## Design System Figma File

**File:** https://www.figma.com/design/p8vIIGE9wPsJI9llj4luac/Scribe-Design-System (file key: `p8vIIGE9wPsJI9llj4luac`)

When a design or screenshot includes a component not yet in `packages/ui`, search for it in this Figma file using the Figma MCP tools (`search_design_system` → `get_design_context`) before building. Apply the token translation rules in the Design Tokens section when reading Figma specs. If the Figma component looks outdated or conflicts with what's in `packages/ui`, flag it and ask the user which is authoritative.

## Component Library (`packages/ui`)

### Available components (import from `@ds/ui`)
`Button`, `IconButton`, `Icon`, `Checkbox`, `Chip`, `Switch`, `TextField`, `TextArea`, `Tabs`, `Badge`, `VisitStatus`, `Link`, `PrimaryNav`, `SecondaryNavItem`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `VersionSwitcher`

### `Switch` — toggle control
```tsx
import { Switch } from "@ds/ui";
<Switch checked={true} onChange={(v) => setState(v)} size="XS" />
```
- `size`: `"XS"` (28×16px track) or `"S"` (34×20px track, default)
- `checked`: controlled boolean
- `onChange`: `(checked: boolean) => void`
- `disabled`: optional boolean

### DS ownership
**`packages/ui` is owned by Cyvian only.** Contributors must never modify it.

Before any DS-related decision, check who is working by running `git config user.email`:
- `cyvian.chen@commure.com` → Cyvian (DS owner)
- Anything else → contributor

### Missing DS components
**If a needed component doesn't exist in `packages/ui`:**
- **If Cyvian** — stop and tell her before building anything. Ask for the Figma spec so it can be added to `packages/ui` properly.
- **If a contributor** — build the component as a standalone in `apps/<project>/src/components/`. Never touch `packages/ui`. The standalone stays local to that prototype forever; if the component is later added to the DS, future prototypes will use the DS version.

### `PrimaryNav` — shared primary navigation
Every prototype uses `<PrimaryNav activeItem="..." />`. The Ambient logo (28px), nav items, and bottom items are all baked in as defaults — the only thing that varies per prototype is which tab is active.

```tsx
import { PrimaryNav } from "@ds/ui";
// activeItem: "visits" | "scribes" | "customize" | "assistant" | "admin"
<PrimaryNav activeItem="visits" />
```

Never rebuild the nav item list from scratch in an app. To add a new top-level nav item or change defaults, update `PrimaryNav` in `packages/ui`. The `logo`, `items`, and `bottomItems` props are available to override defaults when needed.

**Collapsible sidebar:** Pass `onLogoClick` + `sidebarOpen` to `PrimaryNav` to enable the logo-as-collapse-toggle behavior. On hover, the logo swaps to a `left_panel_close`/`left_panel_open` icon. The layout component owns the `sidebarOpen` state and wires up the handler.

### `IconButton` variants
- `tertiary` (default) — brand accent blue icon (`--accent`), litmus-25 hover bg. Use for interactive actions (refresh, thumbs, overflow menus, etc.)
- `tertiary-neutral` — gray icon (`--foreground-secondary`), neutral hover bg. Use for utility/navigation controls (date arrows, secondary actions).

### `SecondaryNavItem` — patient list items
Shared component used in both scribes and visits secondary navs.
- **Scribes mode** (no `time` prop): left = chiefComplaint + age/gender, right = duration
- **Visits mode** (`time` prop set): left = age · gender · duration, right = appointment time

Patient name is always **Title/S** (13px bold, `tracking-[0.13px]`).

### Layout components per page
Each prototype page that needs a secondary nav has its own layout component (app-level, not in `packages/ui`):
- `orders-v1`: `src/components/ScribeLayout.tsx` — scribes secondary nav, patient list with date groups, "Record New Scribe" CTA
- `previsit-customization`: `src/components/VisitLayout.tsx` — visits secondary nav, daily appointment list with date header + prev/next, "Start Instant Visit" CTA; collapsible sidebar (inline on ≥1024px, overlay on hover for 768–1023px)

### Available icons (import from `@ds/ui`)
`AmbientLogo`, `Dictation`, `Learn`, `MagicEdit`, `MagicButton`, `MagicDocument`, `MenuIcon`, `SmartSuggestion`, `Spinner`

### Material icons
Use the `<Icon name="..." size={N} filled? />` component for any Material Symbols Rounded icon.

### Rules
- **Always use existing components** — never recreate a button, checkbox, chip, etc. from scratch
- **If a needed component doesn't exist in `packages/ui`**, stop immediately and tell the user — do not build a one-off inline version. Ask for the Figma spec so it can be added to the DS properly.
- **Never hardcode colors, font sizes, or spacing** that should come from design tokens

---

## Design Tokens

Tokens are CSS custom properties defined in `packages/ui/src/styles/tokens.css`. Always use them via `var(--token-name)` in Tailwind arbitrary values or inline styles.

### Key tokens
- `--foreground-primary` (#1a1a1a) — body text
- `--foreground-secondary` (#666) — secondary/subheading text
- `--accent` (#1132ee) — brand blue, links, interactive
- `--foreground-semantic-danger` (#bb1411) — error/danger
- `--surface-1`, `--surface-2`, `--surface-3` — background layers
- `--litmus-25` through `--litmus-500` — brand/indigo color scale (never call this "indigo" — the product has a separate "Indigo" sub-brand; always use "litmus")

### Figma token name translation
Figma uses slash notation — our code uses hyphens:
- `--text/default` → `--foreground-primary`
- `--text/subheading` / `--shape/secondary` → `--foreground-secondary`
- `--text/brand` → `--accent`
- `--surface/3` → `--surface-3`
- `--orange/200` → `--orange-200`

### Corrected token values (differ from Figma)
- `--green-600`: `#3f8d43`
- `--cyan-800`: `#144852`
- `--magenta-300`: `#e27eb7`
- `--neutral-950`, `--neutral-975`: HSL-interpolated additions not in Figma

---

## Tailwind Usage

- Tailwind JIT requires **static class strings** — never construct class names dynamically (e.g. no `"text-[" + size + "px]"`)
- Use Tailwind arbitrary values for one-off pixel values: `text-[13px]`, `gap-[8px]`, `h-[36px]`
- Use token values via arbitrary properties: `text-[var(--foreground-primary,#1a1a1a)]`
- The fallback value (e.g. `,#1a1a1a`) is required in arbitrary token references so the UI renders without the CSS file loaded

---

## Typography & Style Conventions

- **Never use all-caps text** in UI labels, buttons, or headings — use sentence case or title case only
- **Font**: Lato — loaded via Google Fonts in `index.html`, no local font files needed
- **Font sizes**: use `text-[NNpx]` Tailwind values matching Figma specs; do not use Tailwind's named scale (sm, base, lg, etc.)
- **Letter spacing**: always specify tracking to match Figma exactly (see type scale below)
- **Line height**: use `leading-[1.2]` or `leading-[N]` to match Figma; do not omit

### Type scale (from Figma DS)
| Name | Size | Weight | Tracking | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Title/Nav | 12px | Bold | `tracking-[-0.36px]` | Primary nav labels |
| Title/S | 13px | Bold | `tracking-[0.13px]` | Secondary nav patient names, section headers |
| Title/M | 15px | Bold | `tracking-[0.15px]` | Secondary nav date header |
| Title/L | 17px | Bold | `tracking-[0.34px]` | Secondary nav section titles (e.g. "My Scribes") |

## VersionSwitcher (Round/Direction Navigation)

Every app uses `VersionSwitcher` from `@ds/ui` as the top-level component. Screens are registered in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
const screens: ScreenDef[] = [
  { round: "R1", direction: "Baseline", component: R1Baseline },
  { round: "R1", direction: "Co. Chip",  component: R1CoChip },
];
```

Round labels (R1, R2…) and direction labels are arbitrary strings — use whatever matches the design brief.

**Never modify an existing screen to add a new design idea.** Any time the user asks for a new direction, option, iteration, or variation — create a new screen file and register it as a new entry in `App.tsx`. Existing screens must stay untouched so all directions remain comparable side-by-side.

---

## Browser Verification

Always use **Claude in Chrome** MCP tools to verify UI changes in the browser — never use `preview_start` / `preview_*` tools. The preview tools spawn a node process that triggers a macOS system permission prompt ("node would like to access data from other apps"), which requires manual user interaction every time.

**Workflow:**
1. Start the dev server via Bash (background): `cd "/Users/cyvianchen/Desktop/Ambient Prototypes" && pnpm --filter <app-name> dev -- --port <port> &`
2. Use `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate` to open `http://localhost:<port>`
3. Use `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__computer` or `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_page` to take screenshots / inspect the UI

**Ports by app:**
- `orders-v1` → 5173
- `ds-preview` → 5175
- `previsit-customization` → 5174
- `ds-preview` → 5175

## Deploy

GitHub auto-deploy via Vercel is unreliable. To deploy manually:

```bash
cd "/Users/cyvianchen/Desktop/Ambient Prototypes"
npx vercel --prod
```

The project is linked to `cyvian-chens-projects/ambient-prototypes-orders-v1`. The user controls when to deploy — do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
